# Purpose:
This repository is designed to hold common/reoccurring topics that come up in code reviews. See: [Common Review Quotes](https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7230/common-review-quotes) there was no consensus or good ideas on how to proceed. So I am taking the opportunity to try a couple of experiments and see if there is a good way to achieve this goal.

# Layout:
    README.md           This file
                        Should also contain a list of languages.
    Licensie            Use the same license as Stackexchange (as of Mar/2017)
                        
    Language            For each language we have s subdirectory
        README.md       This contains a README.md file with table of content
        Issue.md        For each issue we have a seprate markdown file with the content.


# Access:
If you have the ability/privileges to edit the tag wiki on https://codereview.stackexchange.com I will give you the ability to edit files in this repository.

Note:
* This is still an experiment.  
* Things may change radically as we move forward.
* The ultimate goal is to build something we can incorporate directly into codereview.stackexchange.com

# Table of Content:

* [C++](C++/README.md)
